# CartoonizerTheWorldUsingTFLite
The TFlite model used a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model proposed in this CVPR 2020 paper Learning to Cartoonize Using White-box Cartoon Representations.https://github.com/SystemErrorWang/White-box-Cartoonization/blob/master/paper/06791.pdf The pretrained weights were provided by the authors of the paper and available in their project GitHub repository here.https://github.com/SystemErrorWang/White-box-Cartoonization
